Brisk Rooms is a cloud-based platform for quick and hassle-free file transfer and content sharing.
The tech-stack used is Flutter and Firebase (firestore, cloud fire storage, cloud functions, hosting)

It will especially be useful for sharing files with a public device (for instance, computers in college labs/ cybercaf√©s) where you do not want to use any of your account credentials.

It involves no creation of users/ signing in.
"Rooms" are temporary storage spaces that can be created using a unique room ID (auto-generated) and custom password.
The room and the files within will be hosted for 6 hours and then automatically deleted.

Users can upload media files/ documents within the room and access/ download the same files from another (remote) device.
There are additional functionalities including a room-integrated notepad for quick sharing of text, and links.
The platform also features authentication, automatic data deletion, etc.
